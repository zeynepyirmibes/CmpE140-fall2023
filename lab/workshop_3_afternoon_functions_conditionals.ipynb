    "\n",
    "Mehmet and Alper are working on an assignment for their data analysis project. They need to create a custom R function that helps them classify data into categories based on certain conditions. The data they have collected is related to student grades and attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an R function called **classify_student** that takes two vectors as input: **grades** and **attendance**. The grades vector represents student grades as numeric values ranging from 0 to 100, and the attendance vector represents the number of days each student attended the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should classify each student's grade into one of the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *F* for grades below 50.\n",
    "* *D* for grades between 50 and 59 (50 included).\n",
    "* *C* for grades between 60 and 69(60 included).\n",
    "* *B* for grades between 70 and 79(70 included).\n",
    "* *A* for grades 80 and above (80 included).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classifying grades, the function should also consider the attendance of each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student's grade is *F* but their attendance is 80% or higher, their grade should be upgraded to *D*.\n",
    "If a student's grade is *A* but their attendance is less than 80%, their grade should be downgraded to *B*.\n",
    "For all other cases, the grade remains the same.\n",
    "The function should return a vector of the same length as the input with the corresponding letter grade for each student, taking attendance into account.\n",
