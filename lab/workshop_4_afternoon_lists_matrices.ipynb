    "Create a function named *matching_lists*. This function should take two lists as input, where each list consists of vectors that can be numeric, character, or logical. The goal of the function is to compare the elements of the two lists and generate a numeric vector as output. The output vector should have the same length as the input lists. It will contain values of 0, 1, or 2 based on the comparison results. Hereâ€™s how the values are determined: \n",

    "2. If the corresponding elements in the input lists have the same type but different lengths, or if they have the same length but different types, then the output vector element takes the value 1. \n",
    "3. If none of the above conditions are met, the output vector element takes the value 0.\n",

    "Now, write a function called **new_field** that takes two inputs, **size** and **density** and creates a square matrix of the given size. The created matrix represents a minefield. The cells should take only two values: if the value is 1, it means there is a mine there and If the value is 0, it means there is no mine. The default values of **size** and **density** should be 5 and 0.2 respectively.\n",
