    "2. Identify and return the names of students who scored higher on the final exam than the midterm exam. \n",

    "4. Calculate and return the overall average exam score (average of midterm and final exam scores) for each student. \n",

    "- It should create a square matrix of size n.\n",
    "- The outer x by x squares of the matrix should be filled with 1's, while the square hole in the middle should be all zeros.\n",
