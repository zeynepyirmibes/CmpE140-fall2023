Then it should find the days that the individual does not work out (so the intensity must be \"none\") and submit those in the list's second element that has **\"shame\"** as a name. Lastly, your function should replace the \"none\"s in the factor **f** with \"light\"s and submit the new factor in the last element of the list which has a name of **\"next_week\"** (remember doing the necessary arrangement in the levels of the factor). \n",
