<h3>Cmpe140 Question</h3>

<h4> General and Important Reminder </h4>
<ul>

<li>Find the <strong>Insert</strong> button on your keyboard (above or near the arrow buttons) and practice with it. If you end up overwriting your code, you will need to press that button.</li>
<br>
<li>Files ending with a ".txt" extension are available for you as the initial form of the question. Do not modify them, they may be necessary if you accidentally delete your solution in the editor.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not write any print/cat or other code to generate output in your code. If you need to, make sure to remove them before submitting the final solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Modify only the editable section(s) between the given markers in <strong>src/Implement.R</strong>. 
<br>You must not remove or modify the markers.
<br>Any other file you create during the exam will be ignored by the grading system. 
<br>Make sure you have the correct file (Implement.R) in the correct form with your solution.

<pre><span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span>

<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_STARTS_RIGHT_AFTER_THIS_LINE </span>
<span style="color:green;"># You can write your code here in this editable section</span>


<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_ENDS_RIGHT_BEFORE_THIS_LINE </span>

<span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span> </pre>
</li>

<li>
You should run the  <strong>src/Test.R</strong> script to check the consistency of your output for grading. <br>
Incorrect output format will result in failure, so do not alter the existing scenarios in the Test.R script. <br>
However, you can add similar scenarios to test the border cases if you prefer. They will also be ignored by the grading system. <br>
</li>
<br>

<li>
There is nothing you are going to do with the Main.R file. <br>
All changes will be ignored and it is not executable in your environment. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
Do not close the Teaching.Codes R Studio Addin !! This will definitely result in loosing your code and failing to submit the answer. 
<br>
You can submit as many times as you wish, only the last submission will be evaluated.
<br>
Your code will not be submitted automatically by the system, you have to do it manually by clicking the "Submit" button for the respective question in the first R Studio window that you have used to login to the system. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Each question may be opened in a new R Studio window, you have to implement the correct question in the respective window for a given description. 
<br>Do not close any of your R Studio windows unless instructed to.
<br>If you logout from the Teaching.Codes plugin, you will have to re-open each question once again.
</li>
</ul>


<h3> Question Description </h3>

Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna are learning how to cast spells. 
<br>They are learning a spell by casting them over and over again. 
<br>The more they perform a spell, the better gets their skill. 

The number of times they cast a spell is given in a vector as such: 
<pre>expelliarmus <- c(Harry = 67, Ron = 23, Hermione = 78, Neville = 10, Luna = 25)
stupefy <- c(Harry = 167, Ron = 6, Hermione = 70, Neville = 36, Luna = 56)</pre>

Professor Snape is trying to find out how well they learned basic Defence Against the Dark Arts spells, since he hates all of them and wants them to fail and get detention. 
<br>
<h4>Part I</h4>
Write a function called <strong><code>most_hateful_student(vec)</code></strong> for Professor Snape, that takes a vector (like <code>expelliarmus</code>) as argument, and returns the name of the student who is worst in performing the spell:

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
expelliarmus <- c(Harry = 67, Ron = 23, Hermione = 78, Neville = 10, Luna = 25)
most_hateful_student(expelliarmus)

'Neville'</pre>
  
<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
stupefy <- c(Harry = 167, Ron = 6, Hermione = 70, Neville = 36, Luna = 56)
most_hateful_student(stupefy)

'Roy'</pre>
  
<h4>Part II</h4>
Write a function called <strong><code>life_isnt_fair(vec)</code></strong> for Professor Snape, that takes a vector (like <code>expelliarmus</code>) as argument, and decreases the number of spells a student has cast with the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If a student performed the spell less than or equal to 30 times, subtract 10 from it. (If the number was already smaller than 10, the updated number of spells should be zero)</li>
<li>If a student performed the spell more than 30 times, subtract 25 from it. </li>  
</ul>

After updating the number of cast spells for the students, sort the vector from largest to smallest, and return the updated and sorted vector from the function. Don't change the names. 

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
expelliarmus <- c(Harry = 67, Ron = 23, Hermione = 78, Neville = 10, Luna = 25)
life_isnt_fair(expelliarmus)

Hermione    Harry     Luna      Ron  Neville 
      53       42       15       13        0 </pre>

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
stupefy <- c(Harry = 167, Ron = 6, Hermione = 70, Neville = 36, Luna = 56)
life_isnt_fair(stupefy)

Harry Hermione     Luna  Neville      Ron 
  142       45       31       11        0  </pre>
