<h3>Cmpe140 Question</h3>

<h4> General and Important Reminder </h4>
<ul>

<li>Find the <strong>Insert</strong> button on your keyboard (above or near the arrow buttons) and practice with it. If you end up overwriting your code, you will need to press that button.</li>
<br>
<li>Files ending with a ".txt" extension are available for you as the initial form of the question. Do not modify them, they may be necessary if you accidentally delete your solution in the editor.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not write any print/cat or other code to generate output in your code. If you need to, make sure to remove them before submitting the final solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Modify only the editable section(s) between the given markers in <strong>src/Implement.R</strong>. 
<br>You must not remove or modify the markers.
<br>Any other file you create during the exam will be ignored by the grading system. 
<br>Make sure you have the correct file (Implement.R) in the correct form with your solution.

<pre><span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span>

<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_STARTS_RIGHT_AFTER_THIS_LINE </span>
<span style="color:green;"># You can write your code here in this editable section</span>


<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_ENDS_RIGHT_BEFORE_THIS_LINE </span>

<span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span> </pre>
</li>

<li>
You should run the  <strong>src/Test.R</strong> script to check the consistency of your output for grading. <br>
Incorrect output format will result in failure, so do not alter the existing scenarios in the Test.R script. <br>
However, you can add similar scenarios to test the border cases if you prefer. They will also be ignored by the grading system. <br>
</li>
<br>

<li>
There is nothing you are going to do with the Main.R file. <br>
All changes will be ignored and it is not executable in your environment. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
Do not close the Teaching.Codes R Studio Addin !! This will definitely result in loosing your code and failing to submit the answer. 
<br>
You can submit as many times as you wish, only the last submission will be evaluated.
<br>
Your code will not be submitted automatically by the system, you have to do it manually by clicking the "Submit" button for the respective question in the first R Studio window that you have used to login to the system. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Each question may be opened in a new R Studio window, you have to implement the correct question in the respective window for a given description. 
<br>Do not close any of your R Studio windows unless instructed to.
<br>If you logout from the Teaching.Codes plugin, you will have to re-open each question once again.
</li>
</ul>


<h3> Question Description </h3>


The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measurement of particulate matter in the air, and shows how polluted the air is. Below is a vector that contains the AQI values (sorted in an ascending way) for some cities in Turkey:

<pre>aqi_2022 <- c(12, 25, 47, 56, 65, 76, 89)</pre>

Assume that the vector will always have an odd number of values. 

Write a function called middle_avg_difference(vec) that finds the AQI value in the middle of the vector, and the average of the values. 
<ul>
<li>If the middle value is larger than the average of the vector, calculate, round (to two decimal places) and return: <strong>middle - average</strong></li>  
<li>If the middle value is smaller than the average of the vector, calculate, round (to two decimal places) and return: <strong>average - middle</strong></li>
<li>If the middle value is equal to the average of the vector, return the character value: <strong>"same"</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<pre>aqi_2022 <- c(12, 25, 47, 56, 65, 76, 89)</pre>

The middle value in <strong>aqi_2022</strong> is <strong>56</strong>, and the average is <strong>52.86</strong>. Then the output is, middle - average = 56 - 52.86 = <strong>3.14</strong>
<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
middle_avg_difference(aqi_2022)
3.14
</pre>


<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<pre>aqi_2021 <- c(12, 13, 14)</pre>

The middle value in <strong>aqi_2021</strong> is <strong>13</strong>, and the average is <strong>13</strong>. Then the output is, the character value <strong>"same"</strong>

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
middle_avg_difference(aqi_2021)
'same'</pre>


<h4>Example 3:</h4>

<pre>aqi_2023 <- c(12, 25, 47, 56, 65, 76, 89, 100, 120)</pre>

The middle value in <strong>aqi_2023</strong> is <strong>65</strong>, and the average is <strong>65.56</strong>. Then the output is, average - middle = 65.56 - 65 = <strong>0.56</strong>
<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
middle_avg_difference(aqi_2023)
0.56</pre>
