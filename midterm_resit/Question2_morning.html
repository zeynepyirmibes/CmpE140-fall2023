<h3>Cmpe140 Question</h3>

<h4> General and Important Reminder </h4>
<ul>

<li>Find the <strong>Insert</strong> button on your keyboard (above or near the arrow buttons) and practice with it. If you end up overwriting your code, you will need to press that button.</li>
<br>
<li>Files ending with a ".txt" extension are available for you as the initial form of the question. Do not modify them, they may be necessary if you accidentally delete your solution in the editor.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not write any print/cat or other code to generate output in your code. If you need to, make sure to remove them before submitting the final solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Modify only the editable section(s) between the given markers in <strong>src/Implement.R</strong>. 
<br>You must not remove or modify the markers.
<br>Any other file you create during the exam will be ignored by the grading system. 
<br>Make sure you have the correct file (Implement.R) in the correct form with your solution.

<pre><span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span>

<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_STARTS_RIGHT_AFTER_THIS_LINE </span>
<span style="color:green;"># You can write your code here in this editable section</span>


<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_ENDS_RIGHT_BEFORE_THIS_LINE </span>

<span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span> </pre>
</li>

<li>
You should run the  <strong>src/Test.R</strong> script to check the consistency of your output for grading. <br>
Incorrect output format will result in failure, so do not alter the existing scenarios in the Test.R script. <br>
However, you can add similar scenarios to test the border cases if you prefer. They will also be ignored by the grading system. <br>
</li>
<br>

<li>
There is nothing you are going to do with the Main.R file. <br>
All changes will be ignored and it is not executable in your environment. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
Do not close the Teaching.Codes R Studio Addin !! This will definitely result in loosing your code and failing to submit the answer. 
<br>
You can submit as many times as you wish, only the last submission will be evaluated.
<br>
Your code will not be submitted automatically by the system, you have to do it manually by clicking the "Submit" button for the respective question in the first R Studio window that you have used to login to the system. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Each question may be opened in a new R Studio window, you have to implement the correct question in the respective window for a given description. 
<br>Do not close any of your R Studio windows unless instructed to.
<br>If you logout from the Teaching.Codes plugin, you will have to re-open each question once again.
</li>
</ul>


<h4> Question Description </h4>

Write a function in R named <code>lucas</code> that takes a non-negative integer 'n' as input and returns the n<sup>th</sup> number in the Lucas series.
<br>The Lucas series starts with the numbers 2 and 1 for n = 0 and n = 1, respectively. 
<br> Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers for n &gt 1.

<ul>
  
  <li>L<sub>0</sub> = 2</li>
  <li>L<sub>1</sub> = 1</li>
  <li>L<sub>n</sub> = L<sub>n-1</sub> + L<sub>n-2</sub></li>
</ul>


<h5>Examples</h5>
<pre><code>
lucas(5) is 7
lucas(23) is 39603
lucas(0) is 2
lucas(1) is 1
lucas(235) is 8.00032847516874e+48

 </code> </pre>
