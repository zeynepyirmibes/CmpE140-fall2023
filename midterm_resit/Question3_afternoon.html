<h3>Cmpe140 Question</h3>

<h4> General and Important Reminder </h4>
<ul>

<li>Find the <strong>Insert</strong> button on your keyboard (above or near the arrow buttons) and practice with it. If you end up overwriting your code, you will need to press that button.</li>
<br>
<li>Files ending with a ".txt" extension are available for you as the initial form of the question. Do not modify them, they may be necessary if you accidentally delete your solution in the editor.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not write any print/cat or other code to generate output in your code. If you need to, make sure to remove them before submitting the final solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Modify only the editable section(s) between the given markers in <strong>src/Implement.R</strong>. 
<br>You must not remove or modify the markers.
<br>Any other file you create during the exam will be ignored by the grading system. 
<br>Make sure you have the correct file (Implement.R) in the correct form with your solution.

<pre><span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span>

<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_STARTS_RIGHT_AFTER_THIS_LINE </span>
<span style="color:green;"># You can write your code here in this editable section</span>


<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_ENDS_RIGHT_BEFORE_THIS_LINE </span>

<span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span> </pre>
</li>

<li>
You should run the  <strong>src/Test.R</strong> script to check the consistency of your output for grading. <br>
Incorrect output format will result in failure, so do not alter the existing scenarios in the Test.R script. <br>
However, you can add similar scenarios to test the border cases if you prefer. They will also be ignored by the grading system. <br>
</li>
<br>

<li>
There is nothing you are going to do with the Main.R file. <br>
All changes will be ignored and it is not executable in your environment. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
Do not close the Teaching.Codes R Studio Addin !! This will definitely result in loosing your code and failing to submit the answer. 
<br>
You can submit as many times as you wish, only the last submission will be evaluated.
<br>
Your code will not be submitted automatically by the system, you have to do it manually by clicking the "Submit" button for the respective question in the first R Studio window that you have used to login to the system. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Each question may be opened in a new R Studio window, you have to implement the correct question in the respective window for a given description. 
<br>Do not close any of your R Studio windows unless instructed to.
<br>If you logout from the Teaching.Codes plugin, you will have to re-open each question once again.
</li>
</ul>


<h3> Question Description </h3>

Write a function in R called <strong>vending_machine</strong> that takes a coin vector and an item name as inputs, and returns the remaining change as another coin vector. 
<br>The vending machine stores five items and accepts coins of 5, 10, and 25 cents i.e. nickel, dime, and quarter, respectively.

<br>
<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Price ($)</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Chips</td>
    <td>1.30</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Chocolate</td>
    <td>1.00</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Coke</td>
    <td>1.60</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Soda</td>
    <td>0.80</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td>0.50</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

Example of named coin vector:

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">coins <- c(nickels = 3, dimes = 1, quarters = 5)
 
 nickels    dimes quarters 
       3        1        5 </pre>


If the user does not have enough money to buy the item, return "Not enough money" instead of remaining coin vector. 
<br>The "machine" should return same named vector of coins as the input. 
<br>When calculating the change vector, the vending machine first attempts to give quarters, then dimes, and finally nickels, regardless of what the customer inserted in the first place.
<br>You can assume that the machine always has sufficient coins to return. 

<br><br>Note that $1 is 100 cents.

<h4>Examples</h4>

<pre style="border:solid 1px; padding :10px; width:650px;">
vending_machine(c(nickels=0, dimes=1, quarters=6), "Coke")

 nickels    dimes quarters 
       0        0        0 
<hr>
vending_machine(c(nickels=0, dimes=2, quarters=5), "Chocolate")

 nickels    dimes quarters 
       0        2        1 
<hr>
vending_machine(c(nickels=2, dimes=2, quarters=1), "Chips")

"Not enough money"
<hr>
vending_machine(c(nickels=2, dimes=2, quarters=4), "Soda")

 nickels    dimes quarters 
       0        0        2 
<hr>
vending_machine(c(nickels=12, dimes=3, quarters=5), "Soda")
 
 nickels    dimes quarters 
       0        1        5 
<hr>
vending_machine(c(nickels=40, dimes=0, quarters=0), "Chocolate")

 nickels    dimes quarters 
       0        0        4 

</pre>
