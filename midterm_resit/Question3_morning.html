<h3>Cmpe140 Question</h3>

<h4> General and Important Reminder </h4>
<ul>

<li>Find the <strong>Insert</strong> button on your keyboard (above or near the arrow buttons) and practice with it. If you end up overwriting your code, you will need to press that button.</li>
<br>
<li>Files ending with a ".txt" extension are available for you as the initial form of the question. Do not modify them, they may be necessary if you accidentally delete your solution in the editor.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not write any print/cat or other code to generate output in your code. If you need to, make sure to remove them before submitting the final solution.</li>
<br>
<li>Modify only the editable section(s) between the given markers in <strong>src/Implement.R</strong>. 
<br>You must not remove or modify the markers.
<br>Any other file you create during the exam will be ignored by the grading system. 
<br>Make sure you have the correct file (Implement.R) in the correct form with your solution.

<pre><span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span>

<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_STARTS_RIGHT_AFTER_THIS_LINE </span>
<span style="color:green;"># You can write your code here in this editable section</span>


<span style="color:blue;"># DO_NOT_REMOVE_MODIFY_OR_REPLICATE_THIS_MARKER__THE_EDITABLE_SECTION_ENDS_RIGHT_BEFORE_THIS_LINE </span>

<span style="color:orange;"># No not write any code here outside the editable section, it will be removed by the grading system</span> </pre>
</li>

<li>
You should run the  <strong>src/Test.R</strong> script to check the consistency of your output for grading. <br>
Incorrect output format will result in failure, so do not alter the existing scenarios in the Test.R script. <br>
However, you can add similar scenarios to test the border cases if you prefer. They will also be ignored by the grading system. <br>
</li>
<br>

<li>
There is nothing you are going to do with the Main.R file. <br>
All changes will be ignored and it is not executable in your environment. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
Do not close the Teaching.Codes R Studio Addin !! This will definitely result in loosing your code and failing to submit the answer. 
<br>
You can submit as many times as you wish, only the last submission will be evaluated.
<br>
Your code will not be submitted automatically by the system, you have to do it manually by clicking the "Submit" button for the respective question in the first R Studio window that you have used to login to the system. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
Each question may be opened in a new R Studio window, you have to implement the correct question in the respective window for a given description. 
<br>Do not close any of your R Studio windows unless instructed to.
<br>If you logout from the Teaching.Codes plugin, you will have to re-open each question once again.
</li>
</ul>


<h4> Question Description </h4>


As the IT administrator of your company, you need to write a function named <strong><code>secure_password</code></strong> that takes a password as input and determines its strength based on the following criteria:

<ul>
  <li>It should have a length longer than 8 characters (length &gt 8).</li>
  <li>It should contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special symbol from the following set <strong>{!, #, + , %, &, *,-}</strong>.</li>
</ul>

For each condition met, the function increments the security class according to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Length > 8: 1 point</li>
  <li>Contains lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol: 1 point each</li>
</ul>

After evaluating the conditions, the function should report the strength of the password according to the following table:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Point</th>
    <th>Strength</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Very Strong</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Strong</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Weak</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Very Weak</td>
  </tr>
  
</table>
 

<h4>Examples</h4>
<pre><code>secure_password("123")
"Very Weak"

secure_password("weakerpass")
"Weak"

secure_password("PassoPass")
"Medium"

secure_password("StrongPassword123")
"Strong"

secure_password("V3ry5trongPassw*rd!23")
"Very Strong" </code> </pre>


<h3> Crucial Hints !!</h3>

<pre># You can separate a string to vector by using following code
password1 <- "StrongPassword123"
strsplit(password1,"")[[1]]</pre>
<br>
<pre># You can check whether a item is inside a vector by using %in% operator
"a" %in% c("a","b","c")</pre>
<br>

<pre>#Check the content of these built-in vectors they can be useful.
letters
LETTERS
# Numbers are characters if they are in a string
c("0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9")</pre>
