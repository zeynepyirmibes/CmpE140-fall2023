    "\n",
    "You are going to write a program that calculates the GPA of a student, and give feedback on how well they're doing. For computing the GPA, universities use the weighted average method, meaning that every course has two compounds: _grades_ and _credit_. To calculate the GPA, student grades and their correspondent credits are individually multiplied, and divided by the total number of credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ GPA = {{Weighted Sum} \\over Total Credits}  $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Credits for the courses can either be 2, 3 or 4. Grades can be anywhere between 0 to 4 with the increment of 0.5 (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ... ,4). There are 6 courses that a student is taking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, student performances are calculated by the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPA < 1 : Fail!\n",
    "- 1 <= GPA <= 2 : Low performance\n",
    "- 2 < GPA <= 3 : Average\n",
    "- GPA < 3 : Excellent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function ```GPA_calculator(credits, grades)``` that will calculate and return as a character value, a student's GPA and their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint: Use ```return(paste(2.84 , \"Average\"))``` to return both the GPA, and the performance of the student, as shown in the examples. \n",
    "* Hint: Remember to ```round``` the calculated GPA to **2 decimal places**. \n",

The program is intended to deduct the price of a meal from the students' cards if they have enough money.
